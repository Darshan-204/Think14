Database Refactoring Script: Add Departments Table

This script implements the database refactoring requirements:
1. Create a new departments table
2. Extract unique department names from products data
3. Populate the departments table with unique departments
4. Update the products table to reference departments via foreign key
5. Update the existing products API to include department information
