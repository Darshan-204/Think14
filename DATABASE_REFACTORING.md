# Database Refactoring - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented the database refactoring requirements to normalize department data using a separate departments table with foreign key relationships.

## 🎯 Requirements Completed

### ✅ 1. Create a new departments table
- **Table Schema**: 
  - `id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
  - `name` (Department name, Unique)
  - `description` (Department description)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)

### ✅ 2. Extract unique department names from products data
- **Extracted Departments**: Men, Women
- **Method**: Query distinct values from existing products.department column

### ✅ 3. Populate the departments table with unique departments
- **Men**: "Men's clothing and accessories"
- **Women**: "Women's clothing and accessories"
- **Records Created**: 2 department records

### ✅ 4. Update the products table to reference departments via foreign key
- **New Column**: `department_id` (Integer, Foreign Key to departments.id)
- **Updated Records**: 29,120 products (100% success rate)
- **Referential Integrity**: All products properly linked to departments

### ✅ 5. Update existing products API to include department information
- **Enhanced Endpoints**: All product endpoints now include department details
- **JOIN Queries**: API uses LEFT JOIN to fetch department information
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original department filtering still works

## 📊 Implementation Results

### Database Structure
```sql
-- New departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Updated products table (added column)
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN department_id INTEGER;
-- 29,120 products updated with department_id values
```

### API Enhancements
- **Products List**: Now includes `department_name` and `department_description`
- **Individual Product**: Enriched with department details via JOIN
- **Statistics**: Department stats now include descriptions
- **Performance**: JOIN queries optimized for efficiency

### Data Verification
- **Total Products**: 29,120
- **Departments Created**: 2 (Men, Women)
- **Update Success Rate**: 100%
- **Data Integrity**: All foreign key relationships valid

## 🚀 API Response Examples

### Products List (Enhanced)
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Seven7 Women's Long Sleeve Stripe Belted Top",
      "department": "Women",
      "department_name": "Women",
      "department_description": "Women's clothing and accessories",
      "cost": 27.05,
      "retail_price": 49.0,
      "brand": "Seven7",
      "category": "Tops & Tees"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Statistics (Enhanced)
```json
{
  "by_department": [
    {
      "department": "Women",
      "description": "Women's clothing and accessories",
      "count": 15989,
      "avg_price": 55.94
    },
    {
      "department": "Men", 
      "description": "Men's clothing and accessories",
      "count": 13131,
      "avg_price": 63.21
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Files Created/Modified
