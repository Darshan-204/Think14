## Features

### Database Queries
- All endpoints use SQL JOIN operations between `products` and `departments` tables
- Efficient querying with proper indexing on foreign keys
- Aggregation functions for statistics (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)

### Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters (e.g., negative department ID)
- **404 Not Found**: Department doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or server errors
- All errors return structured JSON responses

### Filtering & Search
- **Category filtering**: Filter products by category within department
- **Brand filtering**: Filter products by brand within department
- **Price range**: Filter by minimum and maximum retail price
- **Text search**: Search in product names (case-insensitive, partial matching)
- **Sorting**: Sort by multiple fields in ascending or descending order

### Pagination
- Configurable page size (max 100 items per page)
- Complete pagination metadata (total pages, current page, has next/prev)
- Direct links to next/previous pages

### Data Enrichment
- Products include both original `department` field and joined `department_name`/`department_description`
- Department details include top categories and brands with statistics
- All responses include timestamps for cache management

## Database Schema
The endpoints work with the normalized database structure:

**departments table:**
- `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
- `name`
- `description`
- `created_at`

**products table:**
- `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
- `department_id` (FOREIGN KEY â†’ departments.id)
- `name`, `brand`, `category`, `retail_price`, `cost`, etc.

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite is available in `test_department_endpoints.py` that covers:
- Basic functionality of all endpoints
- Error handling (404 responses)
- Filtering and search functionality
- Pagination behavior
- Data validation

Run tests with:
```bash
python test_department_endpoints.py
```

## Performance Considerations
- Queries are optimized with proper JOIN operations
- Pagination prevents large result sets
- Database indexing on `department_id` foreign key
- Limited result sets with configurable limits
- Efficient aggregation queries for statistics
